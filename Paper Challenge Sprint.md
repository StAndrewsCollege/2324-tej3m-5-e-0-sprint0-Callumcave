Prototype 1:

Notes:
Needs more height
This is very possible with the correct planning


Prototype 2:

Notes:
Needs more height 
Less stable than prototype 1

Idea:

Keeps different pieces of paper together 
Minimizes paper wastage

Sketch to expand on the idea above

Used ruler width strips for the larger pieces and 5mm for the smaller pieces

Strong idea originally
Large wastage of paper
Weak Base

Expanded to see how high I could get with all the paper

Conclusion:

The success of this design is that it had a stronger base than in the previous design and it also works because it 
is folded in half for each new level of the design.  For a future design for others, I would advise wasting less paper
 on the knots to tie each component.
